    "brief_summary": "This phase I / II trial studies the side effects and best dose of selumetinib and to see how well it works in treating younger patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 or plexiform neurofibromas that cannot be removed by surgery. Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
    "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), extended tolerability, and recommended phase II dose of selumetinib administered orally every 12 hours on a continuous daily schedule for cycles of 28 days with no rest period between cycles in children and adolescents with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN). (Phase I)\r\nII. To study the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of selumetinib at baseline and steady state. (Phase I)\r\nIII. To evaluate the confirmed partial and complete response rate of selumetinib using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis in children and young adults with NF1 and inoperable PN with PN related morbidity at the time of enrollment. (Phase II)\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine the effect of selumetinib on the growth rate of PN using automated volumetric MRI analysis. (Phase I)\r\nII. To measure adherence of selumetinib chronic dosing in this patient population. (Phase I)\r\nIII. To describe and define the toxicities in pediatric patients on chronic dosing of selumetinib. (Phase I)\r\nIV. To evaluate the confirmed partial and complete response rate of selumetinib in the overall population of all patients treated (patients with and without PN related morbidity at the time of enrollment), and those with “typical PN” versus “nodular PN” versus “solitary nodular PN.” (Phase II)\r\nV. To determine the long-term tolerability and safety of selumetinib. (Phase II)\r\nVI. To determine the duration of response to selumetinib. (Phase II)\r\nVII. To evaluate the effect of selumetinib on bone mineral density in patients at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with impaired bone mineral density at the time of enrollment. (Phase II)\r\nVIII. To characterize the effect of selumetinib on pain, quality of life, and physical functioning. (Phase II)\r\nIX. To determine baseline functional impairments secondary to PN, and the effect of selumetinib on functional outcomes depending on PN location. (Phase II)\r\nX. To determine the effect of selumetinib on the PN growth rate based on volumetric analysis of MRI studies obtained prior to enrollment (if available and amenable to volumetric analysis). (Phase II)\r\nXI. To determine time to progression (TTP) and progression free survival (PFS) in progressive PN (>= 20% increase in PN volume within 12-15 months prior to enrollment), and compare PFS to the placebo arm of the R115777 randomized trial (01-C-0222). (Phase II)\r\nXII. To determine day 1 and steady state pharmacokinetics of selumetinib. (Phase II)\r\nXIII. To evaluate bone marrow derived precursor cells and cytokines pretreatment and on treatment with selumetinib, and to assess if changes in cell and cytokine profiles correlate with imaging response to selumetinib. (Phase II)\r\nXIV. In patients who enroll on this trial with presence of an optic pathway tumor or other glioma not requiring treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy: to evaluate the effect of selumetinib on changes in the size of the optic pathway tumor or other glioma. (Phase II)\r\nXV. To evaluate the effect of selumetinib on extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). (Phase II)\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study, followed by a phase II study.\r\n\r\nPatients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.",

Selumetinib is an ATP-independent inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK or MAPK/ERK kinase) 1 and 2. MEK 1 and 2 are dual-specificity kinases that are essential mediators in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, are often upregulated in various cancer cells, and are drivers of diverse cellular responses, including proliferation. Inhibition of both MEK1 and 2 by selumetinib prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, thereby leading to an inhibition of cellular proliferation in various cancers.
